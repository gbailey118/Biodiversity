# Biodiversity Data Analysis

## Overview

This is a simple portfolio project which I have completed as part of the Codecademy Data Scientist Career Path. Two datasets were provided, one relating to species and the other relating to observations of these species within four US National Parks.I cleaned the data, merged it in a single dataframe and used this to complete my analysis.

## Dataset

The data used for this project comprised two csv files, one with data relating to species and the other observations of these species.

The fields contained within the species file were:

- Category
- Scientific Name
- Common Name(s)
- Conservation Status

The fields in the observations file were:

- Scientific Name
- Park Name
- Observations

## Findings

- Of all categories, vascular plants had by far the highest number of species and highest number of observations
- All of the top 10 species by observations were vascular plants
- The average number of observations per species was similar for all categories i.e. the reason that there were more observations of vasuclar plants is primarily because there are more species than for other categories
- The number of observations differed by park, but the distribution of observations by category was similar for each park
- Only 3.4% of species had a conservation status that indicated that they were a conservation risk
- There are significant differences in conservation statuses by category. Mammals are the most likely species to be at risk; vascular plants are the least likely

Some of the key visuals from the project are shown below:
